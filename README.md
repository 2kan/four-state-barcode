# Four-state barcode

Converts a given string into a four-state barcode using Australia Post's format.

Currently it can encode strings and output a PNG file with the barcode and decode PNG images (but only those created by this project).

This is a side project I work on when I'm feeling uninspired by other things I'm working on, but I would like to complete the Reed Solomon error correction system and the ability to decode barcodes from a photo.
